# Health and Wellness of U.S. College Students – Data Analysis Project

This repository contains code and analysis for our data-driven investigation into the health and wellness of college students in the U.S., focusing on mental and physical health indicators and how they relate to student behavior and academic performance.

## 📊 Project Summary

We utilize two publicly available datasets:

- [Students Mental Health Assessments (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonia22222/students-mental-health-assessments)
- [Student Health Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/student-health-data)

This project is part of our course on applied statistics and data modeling, and explores the following two research questions using standard statistical methods:

## 🧠 Research Questions

### 1. Resting Heart Rate Distribution (Parameter Estimation)

> **Question:**  
What continuous probability distribution best models resting heart rate among college students in the *Student Health Data* dataset? We estimate the distribution parameters (e.g., mean, variance) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and construct 95% confidence intervals.

### 2. Stress Levels by Physical Activity (One-Way ANOVA)

> **Question:**  
Does self-reported stress level differ significantly between students with different levels of physical activity (High, Moderate, Low) in the *Students Mental Health Assessments* dataset? We apply a one-way ANOVA to test for group differences in stress.
